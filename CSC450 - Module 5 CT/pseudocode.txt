Start

Include necessary libraries:
    iostream (for standard input/output)
    fstream (for file handling)
    string (for string manipulation)
    algorithm (for reverse function)

Define the function appendToFile:
    Input: fileName (the name of the file to append data to)
    Open file in append mode (ios::app)
    Check if file is opened:
        If not, display error message and return
    Get user input:
        Prompt the user for input
        Use getline to capture the full line of text
    Write user input to the file
    Close the file
    Display success message

Define the function reverseFileContents:
    Input: inputFileName (the name of the file to read from) and outputFileName (the name of the file to write the reversed content to)
    Open the input file for reading
    Check if file is opened:
        If not, display error message and return
    Read the entire content of the file into a string
    Close the input file
    Reverse the string content using the std::reverse function
    Open the output file for writing
    Check if output file is opened:
        If not, display error message and return
    Write the reversed content to the output file
    Close the output file
    Display success message

In the main function:
    Declare inputFileName as "CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt"
    Declare outputFileName as "CSC450-mod5-reverse.txt"
    Call appendToFile function with inputFileName
    Call reverseFileContents function with inputFileName and outputFileName
    Exit the program

End
