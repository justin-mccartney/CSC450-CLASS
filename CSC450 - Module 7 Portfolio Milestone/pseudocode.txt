Create a main function.

Define two functions:
    countUp to count from 0 to 20.
    countDown to count from 20 to 0.

Include necessary headers:
    iostream for standard input/output.
    thread for thread creation and management.
    mutex to handle any shared resources between threads (though in this case, the threads aren't sharing data, it's good practice to mention).

Use std::thread to create two threads:
    Thread 1 calls the countUp function.
    Thread 2 waits for Thread 1 to finish and then calls countDown.

Join the threads to ensure that both complete their tasks.

Compile and run the code.
